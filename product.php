        <h3>Whiz Watt: Energy Monitoring and Anomaly Detection</h3>
        <p>It is a portable device to be fitted near MCB in people’s home to keep track of energy consumption by each electrical appliance in the home. It has intelligence of appliance recognition, and can provide itemised billing of each appliance, detailed analysis of usage of each appliance to make optimised usage. Once configured, it can also send you alerts, when any appliance is drawing more than 15% of its rated current. This would help in predictive maintenance of the appliances, saving excess energy wastage, and increase the life of the appliance. A patent has been filed for this solution. It would be launched in May 2022.</p>

        <h3>Whiz Farm: An agricultural Drone monitoring health of the crop</h3>
        <p> It would roam by the sides of the crop to cover every plant, based on the given map, and take pictures of the leaves of each plant. Using machine learning algorithm, it would separate healthy leaves and the leaves that are getting some disease. Based on the change in the leaves colour and texture pattern, it would detect specific disease on the crop. It would create a heat map of the plants that have started to getting infected by some disease. Then it can spray the pesticide only on the infected plants. This would help in detecting any crop disease at the earliest stage and also select only infected plants pesticide, keeping precise amount of pesticide to be used. It would help in increasing the yield by minimizing damage by any crop disease, and also cost of pesticide.</p>
